## About the project
I was interested in how rust managed to atain memory safety while acheiving speeds close to C/C++
I wanted to see if there was any trade offs and if I would enjoy the language.

I came to the conclusion that while I can see how useful rust is, battling with the compiler is not very enjoyable and for fututre projects I would be inclined to use something more enjoyable.
If rust could improve the compiler speed it would be great but having to wait over a minute on a small project like this before the compiler tells you about your error was quite frustrating.
In a proffesional security focused setting I could see rust being of great use but would hate to see how long a large project takes to compile
